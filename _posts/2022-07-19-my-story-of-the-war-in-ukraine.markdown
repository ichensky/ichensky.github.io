My name Ivan, I'm software developer from Kyiv, Ukraine. 

On February 24, 2022, I woke up at seven in the morning because of the sounds that came from the street.

I opened the curtains and saw that there was a big traffic jam. But what surprised me the most was that it was from the city center. The cars barely moved. From far away came some clapping like fireworks.

My first thoughts were what the hell, what happened?

I opened the Internet and saw that the war had begun. **Russia invaded Ukraine**.

The news came as a shock to me. In a moment all plans for summer and spring were destroyed. People from Russia came to take away people's houses, steal their cars, money, other stuff and eventually kill them.

There were important questions that needed to be urgently addressed.

- How not to be killed in the end?
