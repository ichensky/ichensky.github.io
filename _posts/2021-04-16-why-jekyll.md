Finally, it happened. I've decided to set up my blog again.<br> 
In the past, I had a blog and several websites powered by Joomla,<br>
Drupal, WordPress, Umbraco, DotNetNuke, NopCommerce, build from scratch<br> 
and powered with Asp.net WebForms, MVC, Core, and so on.<br>

All those CMSes have their pros & cons.<br>
In most cases, they all are too bulky, and took too much time<br>
to support them, namely keep hosting, domain name, certificate,<br>
update code/plugins, os, database, make backups, etc.

On another side I like to use vim, mc, git, and console, also<br>
Github belongs to Microsoft is a big corporation, can be trusted to<br> 
store the site and files, and I could backup them anytime,<br>
also Github supports text preprocessor Jekyll.<br>
Unfortunately, it’s not Razor, but what we have.

With Jekyll, it’s easy to set up a blog at Github and easy enough<br>
to support it. It took me several hours to sort out with Jekyll,<br>
install the plugin for pagination, and add some changes to the website<br>
 navigation bar.


While settuping blog found this liks usefull:

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Official Jekyll website.

[Codinfox-Lanyon](https://github.com/codinfox/codinfox-lanyon) - discovered how to setup pagination & navigation.
