My name Ivan, I'm software developer from Kyiv, Ukraine. 

On February 24, 2022, I woke up at seven in the morning because of the sounds that came from the street. 
[**Russia invaded Ukraine**](https://war.ukraine.ua/).

Russian soldiers with no thought began to kill Ukrainians, rob their houses, loot, bomb hospitals, schools, civilian infrastructure, do absolutely immoral and inhuman things. This act of aggression can only be treated as **genocide of the Ukrainian people**.

The list of [committed war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) grows [every minute](https://liveuamap.com/en).

Help save people from **[Russian aggression](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-stala-najbilshoyu-teroristichnoyu-organizaciyeyu-svit-76089)**.

* Spread information about the war.
* Help Ukrainian refugees in your area.
* Stop buying products made in Russia (bar codes starting with 460-469).
* Call on your employer to take a stand against Russia.
* Ask your politicians to take action.
